<p style="padding:0px;width:100%;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center;font-size:18px;">
In case you are a graduating student of 2022 and are looking to know about the projects I have to offer or ideas to work as BTP or MTP, please have a list of broad areas of projects below.
If you are interested to explore, reach me to discuss no later than 5PM on 8th August. You may mail me introducing yourself and all the information that you think is useful for me.
Candidates with (i) knowlede in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, etc. and (ii) experience with frameworks such as PyTorch in implementing ML stuff would be preferred.</p>

                <li> Learning from long-tailed distributions</li>
                <li> Robustness in DNNs - Understanding and handling the susceptibilities of Deep NNs towards robust and interpretable AI</li>
                <li> Adapting DNNs to challenging environments: Involves developing efficient methods to adapt Deep learning methods and models from laboratory to complex operating environments such as resource constrained, less or no data scenarios.
                <li> Interpretable AI: Involves understanding the learning and inference mechanism in the DNNs from various applications.</li>
                <li> Data Engineering for Deep Learning: Investigates engineering solutions to the data related challenges in learning.</li>
                
I have given the broad research areas in which I am currently working. There are multiple fine-grained problems within each area suitable for various academic levels of investigation. That information can be explored upon a quick discussion with me. The interested candidates should be experienced with ML/DL frameworks (e.g. Pytorch) and concepts. Note that this is not the complete list of projects I can work. I will be more than happy to work on any interesting problem in the broad areas of ML/DL/AI/CV. Candidates with ideas should encourage themselves to have a discussion with me.
