<p style="padding:0px;width:100%;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center;font-size:18px;">
If you are a graduating student (2022) and want to know about the projects I am offering towards your BTP or MTP, you may find a broad list below.
If you are interested to explore, reach me to discuss no later than <mark>5PM on 8th of August</mark>. You may mail me introducing yourself and all the information that you think is useful for me.
Candidates with (i) knowlede in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, etc. and (ii) experience with frameworks such as PyTorch in implementing ML stuff would be preferred.</p>

 These are broad research areas. There are multiple fine-grained problems within each area suitable for various academic levels of investigation, which can be explored upon a quick discussion. Interested candidates should be experienced with ML/DL frameworks (e.g. PyTorch) and concepts.
 I will be more than happy to work on any interesting problem in the broad areas of ML/DL/AI/CV. Candidates with ideas should encourage themselves to have a discussion with me.
